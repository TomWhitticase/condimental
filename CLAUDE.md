# sauce-factory

Factorio-like automation game, themed around sauce production. Pre-alpha.

@docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
@docs/UI_UX.md
@docs/GAMEPLAY.md

The three files above are all authoritative and always apply. ARCHITECTURE.md is
the tech-stack/architecture plan (Rust simulation core + Godot/GDScript
presentation via `gdext`, data-driven recipes, deterministic tick simulation).
UI_UX.md is the visual-style and UI/UX plan (isometric voxel art, 32×32×32
tile-scale assets, industrial sauce-factory theme, Minecraft-adjacent UI with
clipboard/checklist motifs). GAMEPLAY.md is the gameplay/progression/economy
plan (sauce-tier progression gated by equipment unlocks like refrigeration and
acid-handling, money economy, and contracts — not a spot market — as the
demand system, deliberately forcing a diversified factory rather than one
optimized sauce). Always follow all three when writing code — each also
explains *why* its choices were made, which matters when a change seems to
conflict with them.

## Working conventions

- Follow docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for stack/architecture decisions, and
  docs/UI_UX.md for anything visual/UI — don't deviate (e.g. don't reach for
  Unity/Unreal/Bevy, don't put gameplay logic in GDScript, don't hardcode
  recipes/ingredients in Rust, don't introduce flat-textured non-voxel assets
  or a free-rotating camera) without discussing it first.
- This project is being built primarily by Claude Code. When a non-trivial design
  decision gets made that isn't already covered by docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, record
  it in the decisions log below so future sessions don't re-litigate it.
- Prefer small, playable increments over big upfront systems — this is a game, favor "can I run it and see something" early.
- Use plan mode for anything that touches architecture or adds a new major system; small fixes/tweaks don't need it.

## Commit messages

Conventional Commits, enforced by a local `commit-msg` hook + CI. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Run this once per clone/worktree so commits
made here don't get rejected:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Decisions log

- 2026-09-06: Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits (enforced via
  git hook + CI) so history can generate release notes later. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
- 2026-09-06: Adopted the architecture plan in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — Rust
  simulation core (ECS, deterministic ticks) + Godot 4/GDScript presentation via
  `gdext`, data-driven content (RON/JSON). Chosen specifically to be
  agent-friendly (text-native scenes, compiler-error feedback loop, mainstream
  languages). See that doc for full rationale and sources.
- 2026-09-06: Ran a critical review of that architecture doc specifically hunting
  for holes, then resolved every finding into firm decisions rather than leaving
  them open — see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for details. Highlights: simulation state
  is fixed-point, not float (§3.9); ECS is `hecs` + `rayon`, not `bevy_ecs`
  (§1/§3.8); Godot/`gdext`/Rust versions are now pinned (§1a); `SimBridge` gained
  preview/undo/save-format design (§4); a mobile-export spike moved from
  milestone 8 to milestone 2 (§9); primary dev loop is headless `cargo test`, not
  editor hot-reload (§7). Don't re-litigate these without good reason.
- 2026-09-06: Added docs/UI_UX.md as the authoritative visual-style/UI-UX plan,
  kept deliberately separate from docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (looks/feels vs.
  runs/built). Key calls: fixed orthographic isometric camera with 90°
  snap-rotation (no free orbit), full 3D voxel models (not flat-textured
  cubes) at a 32×32×32-voxel tile scale, grounded semi-realistic industrial
  sauce-factory theme, light real-time shaders/lighting ("modded Minecraft
  with shaders" reference point), and a clean Minecraft-adjacent UI built
  around diegetic clipboard/checklist widgets.
- 2026-09-06: Researched and decided the voxel asset pipeline (docs/UI_UX.md
  §2a) — driven by the constraint that assets must be creatable/editable/
  viewable by Claude, not just a human artist. `.vox` (MagicaVoxel format) is
  the asset format, imported into Godot via a community `.vox` plugin. Each
  asset's actual source of truth is a small Rust generator function (not the
  binary `.vox` itself, which is a regenerated build artifact and must never
  be hand-edited); models are "viewed" by rendering an isometric PNG thumbnail
  headlessly via `vengi-voxconvert` and reading that image — no GUI/computer-use
  loop needed. Hand-sculpting in `vengi-voxedit` remains a documented escape
  hatch for one-off assets not worth parametrizing.
- 2026-09-06: Added docs/GAMEPLAY.md as the authoritative gameplay/progression/
  economy plan, kept separate from ARCHITECTURE.md (runs/built) and UI_UX.md
  (looks/feels). Key calls: sauce progression tiers (tomato sauce → ketchup →
  BBQ → equipment-gated categories like mayo/refrigeration and hot
  sauce/acid-handling → elaborate aged/fermented sauces); equipment purchases
  *are* the tech tree (no separate skill-point currency); money economy with
  three cost axes (ingredients, equipment, staff wages); and — the central
  design decision — sales happen via **contracts** (standing orders for a mix
  of sauces on a recurring delivery cadence) rather than a spot market,
  specifically so the winning strategy is a diversified factory rather than
  spamming whichever single sauce is most profitable. See that doc for full
  rationale, the tier table, and open questions (spot-market fallback,
  reputation system, staff-as-mechanic vs. abstract upkeep, spoilage/corrosion
  implementation) left for a future decision.
- 2026-09-06: Extended docs/GAMEPLAY.md with three more firm calls: (1) sauces
  can require other finished sauces as an ingredient (chilli mayo needs mayo +
  hot sauce), giving the sauce list a branching dependency tree — needs no new
  architecture, just the standard intermediate-product recipe pattern; (2)
  sauces come in flavour variants (garlic mayo, spicy BBQ, etc.) built as a
  base sauce plus a cheap flavour-finishing step, and contracts can name a
  specific variant; (3) staff are explicitly **not** simulated NPCs — they're
  an abstract resource pool with four categories (manufacturing, maintenance,
  packaging, logistics) mapped onto the four pipeline stages a sauce passes
  through, where running equipment consumes staff capacity the same way it
  would consume power (understaffing stalls machines, it doesn't simulate a
  missing person). Closest existing architectural analogue is `PowerNetwork`
  (aggregate demand vs. capacity, no per-entity simulation) — see
  docs/GAMEPLAY.md §7 and §9 for the proposed `StaffPools` shape.
- 2026-09-06: Added docs/README.md as a brief docs-folder index (table of the
  three docs + one-line pointer for each) so an agent or human can orient on
  `docs/` without reading everything — not itself authoritative/`@`-included
  (the three docs already are), just a map to them. Any new doc added later
  should get a row here too, per that file's own "Adding a new doc" note.
