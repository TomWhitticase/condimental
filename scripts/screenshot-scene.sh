# Renders godot_project/main.tscn to a PNG for visual review (docs/UI_UX.md).
#
# This is the one verification step in the project that is NOT headless, and
# deliberately so: everything else about this codebase is checked without a
# framebuffer (ARCHITECTURE.md §7), but "does the factory look like UI_UX.md
# describes" cannot be. It opens a real window briefly, waits for lighting to
# settle, writes the frame, and exits.
#
# Pass --populate to run the production chain forward first, so the shot
# shows product moving along the belts instead of an idle factory. Pass
# --first-person to review that camera mode's lighting/skybox instead of the
# default isometric one.
#
# Pass --hover or --hover-pipe to park the cursor over the first machine, or
# over the fluid network's machine-inlet pipe, so that tooltip is in the shot.
#
# Usage: scripts/screenshot-scene.sh [output.png] [WIDTHxHEIGHT] [--populate] [--first-person] [--hover|--hover-pipe]
